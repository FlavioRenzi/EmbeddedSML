# EmbeddedSML
## Library for embedded systems to use SML (Stream Machine Language) in C++.

In this library I implemented 2 algorithm used in for classification in SML:
 - `Naive Bayes`
 - `Hoeffding Tree`

## Repo structure
In the repo ypu can find 2 main folders:
 - `ArduinoLearner`: contains the platform.io project for the Arduino
 - `Streamer`: contains a Jupiter notebook to stream data from the dataset file to the Arduino and collect the results
